Electricity Price Guessing with Machine Learning Algorithms

The purpose of the software is to use the average data for 2019.
Electricity prices using different machine learning methods
is to guess.
Estimation, using different regression methods
is carried out. Dependent variables of the week in the literature
days, seasons, amount of demand, amount of production and natural gas
prices.
â€¢ The program is written in Python, and any Python
can be used in an environment.

Steps for the user to calculate the wholesale electricity price:
 1) He must select and enter the variables on the interface and click the price button.
 2) It is necessary to run the program to open the interface. For the program to run; The libraries in the code page are installed on the computer.
 The model must be trained only once by the computer to be used. The 1-time trained file will be saved as a pickle.
 When the program is run, the interface and then the graphics will be displayed sequentially.
