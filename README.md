# Predicting Wholesale Electricity Prices with Machine Learning


The purpose of the software is to predict electricity prices with different machine learning methods using average data for 2019. Estimation is performed using different regression methods. In the literature, the dependent variables of the week are days, seasons, demand amount, production amount and natural gas prices. 
â€¢ The program is written in Python and can be used in any Python environment.

Steps for the user to calculate the wholesale electricity price:
 1) He must select and enter the variables on the interface and click the price button.
 2) It is necessary to run the program to open the interface. For the program to run; The libraries in the code page are installed on the computer.
 The model must be trained only once by the computer to be used. The 1-time trained file will be saved as a pickle.
 When the program is run, the interface and then the graphics will be displayed sequentially.
